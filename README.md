### Pi
This repository includes all of Kyle and Caleb's Raspberry Pi Code. Python is the language of choice.
Much of the code follows the book *Learning Python with Raspberry Pi* by Alex Bradbury and Ben Everard (files with chapters in title refer to chapters in this book). The book *Raspberry Pi User Guide* by Eben Upton and Gareth Halfacree is used as a reference.

# *Learning Python* Chapter 2
